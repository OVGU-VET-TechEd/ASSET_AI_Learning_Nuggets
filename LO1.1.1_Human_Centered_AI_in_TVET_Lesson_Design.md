<div class="framework-card">
**Core Human-Centered AI Principles:**

1. **Human Agency** - AI should augment human capabilities, not replace human decision-making
2. **Transparency** - Users should understand how AI systems work and make decisions  
3. **Fairness** - AI should treat all users equitably without bias or discrimination
4. **Privacy** - Personal data should be protected and used only with informed consent
5. **Accountability** - Clear responsibility for AI outcomes and the ability to appeal decisions
6. **Safety** - AI systems should be tested, monitored, and designed to avoid harm
</div>

### Real-World Foundation: Stanford HAI Perspective

The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence defines their mission as ensuring "AI should be collaborative, augmentative, and enhancing human productivity and quality of life" rather than replacing human judgment. This principle is especially crucial in educational settings where the goal is human development.

**Video Introduction:** Stanford HAI Launch

> üé• **Watch:** [Stanford HAI Institute Introduction](https://hai.stanford.edu/about/introduction)
> 
> **Key Takeaway:** "putting humanity at the center of AI" requires intentional design choices that prioritize human values over technological capability alone.

@scenarioBox(Maria teaches automotive technology at a technical college. A new AI-powered diagnostic system claims to identify engine problems 95% faster than traditional methods. Should she integrate this tool into her curriculum? What questions should she ask first?)

    [[ ]] Context Appropriateness - Does it fit our technical focus?
    [[?]] Select all that apply for initial evaluation
    <script>
      let correct = [0, 1, 2];
      let selected = @input;
      
      let isCorrect = correct.every(i => selected.includes(i)) && 
                     selected.every(i => correct.includes(i));
      
      if (isCorrect) {
        send.lia("‚úÖ **Excellent!** Educational value, human agency, and data safety are the three most critical initial considerations. Context comes later in the evaluation process.");
      } else {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Consider all critical factors.** Think about learning outcomes, student autonomy, and data protection as primary concerns.");

## Case Study: Complete Tool Evaluation

> **Real-World Application: Automotive Diagnostics AI**

**Context:** TechVoc College is considering "AutoMech Pro," an AI diagnostic tool for their automotive technology program. The tool uses machine learning to analyze engine sounds, vibration patterns, and diagnostic data to suggest probable causes of mechanical problems.

**Tool Claims:**
- 90% accuracy in identifying common engine issues
- Reduces diagnostic time by 70%
- Includes database of 50,000+ repair cases
- Available in 12 languages
- Costs ‚Ç¨2,500/year for 30-student license

**Your Challenge:** Complete a full ETHICS framework evaluation and make a recommendation.

### Guided Analysis

> **Educational Value Assessment**

Consider the learning objectives for automotive diagnostics:

    [( )] AI enhances learning by providing immediate feedback on diagnostic hypotheses
    [( )] AI replaces the need for students to develop systematic diagnostic skills  
    [( )] AI provides additional practice scenarios beyond available equipment
    [(X)] AI should supplement, not substitute for, fundamental skill development
    [[?]] What's the primary educational consideration?
    <script>
      if (@input === 3) {
        send.lia("‚úÖ **Correct!** The key is ensuring AI enhances rather than replaces essential diagnostic reasoning skills that students need to develop.");
      } else {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Consider more carefully.** Think about the balance between AI assistance and essential skill development.");
      }
    </script>

**Discussion Points:**
- How could AutoMech Pro be used to enhance rather than replace diagnostic skill development?
- What safeguards would ensure students still learn to use manual diagnostic methods?
- How might the tool prepare students for AI-enhanced automotive workplaces?
