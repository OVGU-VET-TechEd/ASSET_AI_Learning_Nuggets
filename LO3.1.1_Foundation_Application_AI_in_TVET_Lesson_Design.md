# AI Development Process: Data, Algorithms, and Architecture

**Understanding How AI Systems Are Built and Deployed in TVET Contexts**

> **Learning Objective (Acquire Level):** Understand how AI systems are developed using data, algorithms, and computing architecture, and identify the key steps in the AI development life cycle.

**Professur f√ºr Ingenieurp√§dagogik und technische Bildung**  
**Lehrstuhl:** Prof. Dr. Frank B√ºnning  
**Presenter:** Hannes Tegelbeckers  
**Faculty of Human Sciences**

## Workshop Overview

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* **Describe** how AI systems are developed using data, algorithms, and computing resources
* **Identify** the key steps in the AI development life cycle from problem scoping to deployment
* **Understand** basic data types and the difference between classification and regression
* **Recognize** the computing infrastructure needed for AI systems
* **Apply** this knowledge in hands-on activities with AI development tools

## Part 1: The AI Development Life Cycle

### Understanding the Development Process

> **AI Development** follows a systematic process that ensures we solve the right problem and build effective solutions step by step.

The AI development process consists of seven key stages that guide us from initial idea to deployed solution:

@lifecycleStep(1,Problem Scoping,Define the problem clearly and identify success criteria. Example: "Detect defective products with 95% accuracy")

@lifecycleStep(2,Data Collection & Preparation,Gather relevant data and clean it for training. High-quality data is crucial for effective models)

@lifecycleStep(3,Design (Algorithm Selection),Choose the right AI approach - classification for categories or regression for numeric predictions)

@lifecycleStep(4,Training,Use collected data to teach the AI model. The algorithm learns patterns from examples)

@lifecycleStep(5,Testing & Evaluation,Test the model on new data to verify it can generalize beyond training examples)

@lifecycleStep(6,Deployment,Integrate the trained model into the real-world environment where it will be used)

@lifecycleStep(7,Feedback & Iteration,Monitor performance and continuously improve the system with new data and feedback)

### Interactive Life Cycle Explorer

Click through the stages to understand the AI development process:

    {{0}}
**Stage 1: Problem Scoping**

Why is this stage critical? Clear problem definition ensures the AI project addresses real needs and has measurable success criteria.

**Example in TVET Context:** 
*"Create an AI system to predict when workshop equipment needs maintenance with 90% accuracy to reduce unexpected breakdowns."*

    {{1}}
**Stage 2: Data Collection & Preparation**

What makes good data? Relevance, quality, and representativeness of the scenarios you expect the AI to handle.

**TVET Example:**
- Sensor readings from machines
- Historical maintenance records  
- Images of equipment conditions
- Environmental factors (temperature, humidity)

    {{2}}
**Stage 3: Design (Algorithm Selection)**

How do we choose the right approach?

**Classification:** Sorting into categories (healthy vs. faulty equipment)
**Regression:** Predicting numeric values (hours until maintenance needed)

    {{3}}
**Stage 4: Training**

The model learns from examples through iterative improvement, often requiring significant computing power for complex problems.

    {{4}}
**Stage 5: Testing & Evaluation**

Models are tested on new, unseen data to measure real-world performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

    {{5}}
**Stage 6: Deployment**

The model is integrated into the actual working environment - factory floor, lab, or field setting.

    {{6}}
**Stage 7: Feedback & Iteration**

Continuous monitoring and improvement based on real-world performance and changing conditions.

## Part 2: Key Concepts - Data, Algorithms, and Computing Architecture

### Understanding Data in AI

@conceptCard(Data - The Foundation,Raw material from which AI learns patterns - numbers, text, images, audio, sensor readings)

**Data Quality Factors:**

* **Relevance** - Data must match the problem domain
* **Accuracy** - Clean, error-free information  
* **Completeness** - Comprehensive coverage of scenarios
* **Representativeness** - Reflects real-world conditions

**TVET Data Examples:**
- **Welding Course:** Temperature and vibration readings from equipment
- **Agriculture:** Soil moisture, weather data, crop health images
- **Automotive:** Engine diagnostic codes, sensor measurements

### Quiz: Data Understanding

Test your knowledge of data concepts:

    [( )] Data quantity is always more important than data quality
    [(X)] High-quality, relevant data is more valuable than large amounts of poor data
    [( )] AI can automatically fix problems with bad data
    [( )] Any type of data can be used for any AI problem
    [[?]] Which statement about data in AI is most accurate?
    <script>
      if (@input === 2) {
        send.lia("‚úÖ **Correct!** 'Garbage in, garbage out' - AI systems are only as good as the data they're trained on. Quality and relevance matter more than sheer quantity.");
      } else if (@input === 1) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Incorrect.** While more data can help, quality and relevance are more important than quantity alone.");
      } else if (@input === 3) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Incorrect.** AI cannot automatically fix fundamental data quality issues - preprocessing and cleaning are essential.");
      } else if (@input === 4) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Incorrect.** Different AI problems require different types of relevant data - image data won't help with text analysis.");
      }
    </script>

### Understanding Algorithms

@conceptCard(Algorithms - The Brain,Procedures that learn from data to make predictions or decisions)

**Key Algorithm Types:**

**Classification Algorithms**

    <script>
      if (@input === 2) {
        send.lia("‚úÖ **Excellent!** Yes/no decisions about categories (fracture present or not) are classification problems.");
      } else if (@input === 1) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Incorrect.** Predicting specific temperature values is regression (continuous numbers).");
      } else if (@input === 3) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Incorrect.** Estimating hours is regression (predicting a continuous numeric value).");
      }
    </script>

## Part 5: Understanding and Assessment

### Knowledge Check Quiz

Test your understanding of AI development concepts:

**Question 1: Development Life Cycle**

Which step should come directly AFTER training a model?

    [( )] Data collection
    [( )] Deployment  
    [(X)] Testing and evaluation
    [( )] Problem scoping
    [[?]] Select the correct sequence step
    <script>
      if (@input === 3) {
        send.lia("‚úÖ **Correct!** Testing on new data is crucial before deployment to verify the model generalizes well.");
      } else if (@input === 2) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Not quite.** You shouldn't deploy without testing first - you need to verify performance on unseen data.");
      } else if (@input === 1) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Incorrect.** Data collection happens earlier in the process, before training.");
      } else if (@input === 4) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Incorrect.** Problem scoping is the very first step, not after training.");
      }
    </script>

**Question 2: Computing Architecture**

You want to create an AI system for real-time quality inspection on a factory floor. Which computing approach is most appropriate?

    [( )] Cloud-only processing
    [(X)] Edge computing with local processing
    [( )] Manual processing without AI
    [( )] Batch processing once per day
    [[?]] Choose the best architecture approach
    <script>
      if (@input === 2) {
        send.lia("‚úÖ **Excellent choice!** Edge computing provides the low latency needed for real-time quality inspection without network delays.");
      } else if (@input === 1) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Not ideal.** Cloud processing would introduce latency that interferes with real-time inspection needs.");
      } else if (@input === 3) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Misses the opportunity.** AI can provide more consistent and faster inspection than manual processes.");
      } else if (@input === 4) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Too slow.** Quality inspection needs to happen in real-time as products are manufactured.");
      }
    </script>

**Question 3: Data and Algorithms**

You're teaching automotive maintenance and want to predict when engines need servicing. What type of algorithm and data would you need?

    [( )] Classification algorithm with images of engines
    [(X)] Regression algorithm with sensor data and maintenance history
    [( )] Classification algorithm with text descriptions
    [( )] No algorithm needed, just expert rules
    [[?]] Select the most appropriate approach
    <script>
      if (@input === 2) {
        send.lia("‚úÖ **Perfect!** Predicting 'when' (time until maintenance) is regression, and sensor data provides the quantitative inputs needed.");
      } else if (@input === 1) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Wrong algorithm type.** Classification categorizes things, but you want to predict a timeframe (regression).");
      } else if (@input === 3) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Both wrong.** You need regression for time prediction, and text descriptions lack the precision of sensor data.");
      } else if (@input === 4) {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Missing AI benefits.** Machine learning can find patterns in data that expert rules might miss.");
      }
    </script>
