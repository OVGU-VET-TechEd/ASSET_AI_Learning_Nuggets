# Nugget 2: Applying AI Tools in Practice (Level 2: Deepen)

                          --{{0}}--
Welcome to the second module where we focus on practical application. How can vocational educators actually use AI tools in real teaching scenarios and critically evaluate them? Let's move from just knowing about AI to actually using and adapting AI in your professional practice.

*Knowledge Deepening* – This second module is for the **Deepen** level of UNESCO's AI Competency Framework Category 3 (AI Foundations & Applications). Here we focus on practical application: how can vocational educators **use AI tools** in real teaching scenarios and critically evaluate them? By deepening your skills, you'll move from just knowing about AI to actually using and adapting AI in your professional practice. Let's dive into hands-on examples, integration strategies, and considerations for using AI effectively and ethically in TVET settings.

## Recap: From Acquire to Deepen

                          --{{0}}--
Before jumping into new material, let's quickly recap the foundation from the Acquire level and clarify what Deepen means. At the Acquire stage, you learned basic AI concepts and saw simple examples.

*Knowledge Acquisition* – Before jumping into new material, let's quickly recap the foundation (Acquire level) and clarify what *Deepen* means. At the Acquire stage, you learned basic AI concepts and saw simple examples. Now at **Deepen**, the goal is to **apply** that knowledge:

     {{1}}
* You should be able to **operate AI tools** commonly found in education or your industry. For example, using an AI-driven language translation app in class or a machine learning-based simulator in a workshop.

     {{2}}
* You'll learn more about *how* certain AI systems work under the hood. This doesn't mean becoming a data scientist, but for instance, understanding the steps an AI tool takes to arrive at a recommendation or prediction.

     {{3}}
* Importantly, **critical thinking** is key at this level. You'll practice examining whether a specific AI tool is appropriate for your educational context. Does it actually help learning? Is it biased or fair? Is it secure and respecting privacy? Deepening is not just doing more, but thinking deeper.

                          --{{4}}--
According to UNESCO's framework, at the Deepen level teachers proficiently operate AI tools, learn how selected AI systems are trained and work, and use that know-how to start designing AI-related learning activities.

     {{4}}
According to UNESCO's framework, at the Deepen level teachers *"proficiently operate AI tools…, learn how selected AI systems are trained and work, and use that know-how to start designing AI-related learning activities"*. We will incorporate these ideas throughout this module.

## AI Tools for Educators: What's Out There?

                          --{{0}}--
First, let's survey the landscape of AI tools that teachers can use. There are many options available, but we'll highlight key categories with practical examples for vocational education.

*Knowledge Acquisition* – First, let's survey the landscape of AI tools that teachers (including vocational educators) can use. There are many, but we'll highlight a few categories with examples:

                            {{British Female |>}}
**************************************************
Let's explore five main categories of AI tools that can transform your teaching practice. Each category offers unique opportunities to enhance student learning and streamline your workflow.
**************************************************

     {{1}}
* **Intelligent Tutoring Systems:** These are AI-powered programs that can provide one-on-one tutoring to students by adapting to their responses. Example: *CenturyTech* or *Knewton* (for academic subjects) or a specialized system for vocational training like an AI tutor for electrical wiring practice. These systems analyze student answers and tailor the next question or hint. As a teacher, you might use them to complement your instruction, letting the AI tutor give students extra practice on basics while you focus on advanced skills.

     {{2}}
* **Automated Assessment Tools:** Grading and feedback take time. AI can help by automatically grading quizzes or even essays (to an extent) and providing feedback. For instance, *Turnitin's AI Write Check* can give feedback on student writing, and tools like *Gradescope* (with AI assistance) can group similar answers to speed up marking. In vocational training, suppose students submit circuit diagrams or code – AI image recognition or code analysis tools might evaluate certain aspects automatically, flagging errors or common issues for you.

     {{3}}
* **Content Creation and Preparation:** Need quiz questions, lesson plans, or demo data? Generative AI can assist. Tools like **ChatGPT** or **Bing Chat** (with appropriate use) can help brainstorm quiz questions, explain concepts in simpler terms, or create draft lesson outlines. There are also AI-driven lesson planners specifically for teachers (for example, *EduAide.ai* helps generate worksheets or activities on a given topic). At Deepen level, you should be comfortable leveraging these to save time *but also reviewing them for accuracy*.

     {{4}}
* **Media Generation:** AI can create images, audio, or even simple videos. Imagine needing an illustration of a mechanical part or a sample piece of code output – AI image generators (like DALL·E or Stable Diffusion) or code generators can produce these on the fly. Some vocational teachers use AI to create simulations or virtual scenarios (e.g., an AI-generated animation of an assembly process). *Note:* Always check usage rights and accuracy; AI images might not be perfect (e.g., extra fingers in images, etc. – they sometimes make mistakes!).

     {{5}}
* **Administrative Assistants:** AI can automate routine tasks like scheduling, communication, and data analysis. For example, an AI scheduling assistant can help optimize timetables or meetings. Learning management systems (LMS) now often include AI analytics that identify students at risk by analyzing grades and engagement – as a teacher, you'd *apply* these insights by intervening with those students.

### Engaging with an AI Tool – An Example

                          --{{0}}--
It's one thing to list tools, but let's walk through using one in practice. Let's consider a scenario where you want to provide personalized practice problems in an auto mechanics course.

*Knowledge Deepening* – It's one thing to list tools, but let's walk through using one in practice. **Scenario:** You have a diverse class of trainees and want to provide *personalized practice problems* in an auto mechanics course. Some students struggle with engine diagnostics, others with electrical systems. You decide to use an AI tool to help generate practice questions tailored to each student's needs.

                          --{{1}}--
One approach is to use a generative AI like ChatGPT with the right prompt. For example, you might input: "Generate a few multiple-choice questions about diagnosing common engine problems for a beginner-level student."

     {{1}}
One approach: use a generative AI (like ChatGPT) with the right prompt. For example, you might input: *"Generate a few multiple-choice questions about diagnosing common engine problems for a beginner-level student."* The AI will produce questions (and answers) which you can review and give to students who need basics. For advanced students, you prompt: *"Now generate harder scenario-based questions on engine diagnostics for an advanced student."*

                          --{{2}}--
This practice of prompting is a new skill for teachers – often called "prompt engineering." At Deepen level, experimenting with it can greatly enhance your productivity.

     {{2}}
**Try it yourself (mentally or with a tool):** What kind of prompts or inputs would you give an AI to create resources for your class? This practice of *prompting* is a new skill for teachers – often called "prompt engineering." At Deepen level, experimenting with it can greatly enhance your productivity.

                          --{{3}}--
Always review AI-generated content. Ensure it's correct and appropriate. AI might occasionally produce incorrect information or phrasing that doesn't fit your context.

     {{3}}
**Caution:** Always **review AI-generated content**. Ensure it's correct and appropriate. AI might occasionally produce incorrect info or phrasing that doesn't fit your context. Part of deepening your competency is developing a critical eye for AI outputs – don't use them blindly.

### Interactive Exercise: Prompt Engineering

                          --{{4}}--
Let's practice prompt engineering for your specific teaching context. Consider how you would structure prompts for different educational needs.

## Hands-On: Training a Simple Model (Advanced Example)

                          --{{0}}--
In Module 1, we used a simple pre-made model. Now, we'll go a bit further by using data to train and apply an AI model in a practical context. This is a valuable exercise to deepen understanding of how AI tools work under the hood.

*Knowledge Deepening* – In Module 1, we used a simple pre-made model. Now, we'll go a bit further: using data to train and apply an AI model in a practical context. This isn't something you *must* do as a teacher, but it's a valuable exercise to deepen understanding of how AI tools work under the hood. Consider it a peek "behind the curtain" of AI applications.

                          --{{1}}--
Suppose you want to predict which students might need extra help in a course, using data like hours of study and previous scores. We'll create a simple machine learning model to do that.

     {{1}}
**Example:** Suppose you want to predict which students might need extra help in a course, using data like hours of study and previous scores. We'll create a **simple machine learning model** to do that. This is analogous to learning analytics systems some schools use.

```python
# Deepen-level code example: Predicting if a student needs help (at-risk student prediction)
# We use a simple dataset of students with [weekly study hours, previous exam score] -> label (1 = needs help, 0 = on track)

import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Sample data: [study_hours, prev_score] and whether they needed help (1) or not (0)
X = np.array([
    [2, 50],   # 2 hours/week, prev score 50 -> needed help (likely low engagement and low score)
    [5, 70],   # 5 hrs, score 70 -> no help needed (decent study and score)
    [1, 40],   # 1 hr, score 40 -> needed help
    [3, 65],   # 3 hrs, score 65 -> no help (borderline but okay)
    [4, 55],   # 4 hrs, score 55 -> maybe needs help (moderate study but low score)
    [6, 80],   # 6 hrs, score 80 -> no help
])
y = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0])  # Labels corresponding to above (just a hypothetical pattern)

# Train a simple logistic regression model (common for binary classification)
model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', random_state=0)
model.fit(X, y)

# Define a function to interpret model output
def predict_need_help(study_hours, prev_score):
    prob = model.predict_proba([[study_hours, prev_score]])[0][1]  # probability of class 1 (needs help)
    return prob

# Test the model with a new student scenario
new_student = [3, 50]  # e.g., studies 3 hours/week, previous score 50
prob_help = predict_need_help(new_student[0], new_student[1])
print(f"Model probability that student needs help: {prob_help*100:.1f}%")
print("Prediction:", "Needs extra support" if prob_help >= 0.5 else "Likely on track")
```

                          --{{2}}--
When you run this, the model will output a probability. For example, with 3 hours study and score 50, it might say around 60-70% chance the student needs help. Feel free to adjust the new_student values and run again.

     {{2}}
When you run this, the model will output a probability. For example, with 3 hours study and score 50, it might say around 60-70% chance the student needs help (and thus prediction "Needs extra support"). **Feel free to adjust** `new_student` values and run again. Try scenarios: a very diligent student (e.g. 6 hours, score 60) vs a disengaged one (e.g. 1 hour, score 60) to see how it changes the probability.

                          --{{3}}--
The model is basically a simple formula it learned from the data. If study hours are low and past score is low, probability of "needs help" goes up. This illustrates how AI tools in schools might flag at-risk students.

     {{3}}
**Understanding the Output:** The model is basically a simple formula it learned from the data. If study hours are low and past score is low, probability of "needs help" goes up. This is a toy model, not accurate for real decisions, but it illustrates how AI tools in schools might flag at-risk students – by training on historical data of who needed help in the past.

                          --{{4}}--
As teachers deepening our AI competency, we should ask: Is this prediction fair and useful? What about students who had low scores but can bounce back with motivation? Your professional judgment is irreplaceable.

     {{4}}
**Pedagogical reflection:** As teachers deepening our AI competency, we should ask: *Is this prediction fair and useful?* What about students who had low scores but can bounce back with motivation – a model might not see their personal context. Thus, while AI can provide insights (like highlighting who might need tutoring), **your professional judgment is irreplaceable**. Use AI as a support tool, not the sole decision-maker. That aligns with a human-centered approach to AI in education.

### Critical Thinking Exercise

                          --{{5}}--
Let's reflect on the ethical implications of using AI for student prediction. Consider these important questions about fairness and bias.

     {{5}}
**Reflect on AI Ethics in Education:**

What potential biases might exist in a student prediction model?
[[ ]]

How would you ensure fair treatment of all students when using AI analytics?
[[ ]]

What role should human judgment play alongside AI predictions?
[[ (Essential - final decisions) | (Minimal - trust the data) | (Optional - AI is objective) | (Collaborative - combine both) ]]

## Best Practices for Integrating AI in Teaching

                          --{{0}}--
Now that we've explored using AI tools, let's summarize some best practices and considerations when applying these tools in your teaching practice. This is where pedagogy and digital skills meet.

*Knowledge Deepening* – Now that we've explored using AI tools, let's summarize some best practices and considerations when applying these tools in your teaching practice. This is where pedagogy and digital skills meet: how you incorporate AI in a way that truly benefits learning.

                            {{American Female |>}}
**************************************************
Remember the golden rule: Pedagogy first, technology second. This ensures that AI serves your teaching, not the other way around.
**************************************************

     {{1}}
* **Align with Learning Objectives:** Use AI intentionally to support your goals. Don't use a fancy AI tool just for the sake of it. For example, if the objective is to improve students' CNC machining skills, an AI-driven simulator or tutor for CNC can be great. But an AI trivia quiz on random topics would be a distraction. Always ask: *Does this tool help my students learn or practice the target skill/knowledge?*

     {{2}}
* **Keep the Teacher in Control:** AI can automate tasks or provide recommendations, but you remain the expert of your classroom. Maintain control by reviewing AI outputs and deciding how to use them. If an AI grading tool marks an answer wrong but you know it's actually a valid approach, override it. **Teachers, not AI, should make final pedagogical decisions**.

     {{3}}
* **Transparency with Students:** Let your learners know when an AI is being used and how. For instance, if you use an AI system to give them feedback on an assignment, explain that "This feedback was generated by an AI tool that checks grammar and structure. I will still review your content depth myself." This helps students learn to critically engage with AI too, an important digital skill.

     {{4}}
* **Data Privacy and Ethics:** Be mindful of what student data you feed into AI tools. Many AI applications require data upload (like student work, or personal information). Ensure the tools are approved by your institution or follow privacy laws (GDPR, etc.). Avoid entering sensitive data into third-party AI services unless you're sure it's safe and allowed. Ethically, we also want to avoid AI that could reinforce biases – e.g., if an AI translation consistently uses male pronouns for engineers and female for nurses, point it out and discuss biases with students.

     {{5}}
* **Inclusivity and Accessibility:** AI tools should augment learning for *all* students. Check if the tool has features for students with disabilities (screen-reader friendly, captions on AI videos, etc.). Also, watch out that AI models aren't disadvantaging students who are already struggling. For example, an AI tutor might give fewer challenges to a student who got many answers wrong, but perhaps that student just needed a different explanation method. Use AI to personalize support, but also ensure each student gets the encouragement and high expectations they deserve.

     {{6}}
* **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:** The AI landscape evolves quickly. New tools appear, old ones get better. As part of Deepen (and moving toward *Create* level eventually), stay curious. Join educator communities (online forums, local meetups) to share experiences on using AI in teaching. For instance, a fellow TVET teacher might share how they used an AI vision system in a welding class to provide instant feedback on technique – you could try something similar if it fits your context.

                          --{{7}}--
One helpful mantra to remember is: "Pedagogy first, technology second." This ensures that AI serves your teaching, not the other way around.

### AI Integration Checklist

                          --{{8}}--
Use this practical checklist when considering any AI tool for your classroom. It will help you make informed decisions about AI integration.

     {{8}}
**Before Implementing an AI Tool:**

? Check all factors you should consider before using an AI tool in your classroom:
[[ ]] Does it align with my learning objectives?
[[ ]] Have I tested it thoroughly myself?
[[ ]] Do I understand how it works and its limitations?
[[ ]] Is it accessible to all my students?
[[ ]] Does it comply with privacy requirements?
[[ ]] Have I planned how to introduce it to students?
[[ ]] Do I have a backup plan if it doesn't work as expected?
[[ ]] Will I maintain oversight and control over its use?

## Knowledge Check (Quiz)

                          --{{0}}--
Test your grasp of the concepts from this Deepen module. Think carefully about each scenario and consider the best practices we've discussed.

*Knowledge Deepening* – Test your grasp of the concepts from this Deepen module:

**Quiz 1:** You're considering an AI tool that auto-grades student practical assignments. What factors should you evaluate before using it? (Select **ALL** that apply)

                          --{{1}}--
When adopting any AI grading tool, you need to consider multiple factors including alignment with objectives, potential bias, data privacy, and your ongoing role in the assessment process.

? Key considerations when adopting an AI grading tool:
[[X]] Whether the tool's grading criteria align with your learning objectives (so it doesn't misjudge what you value).
[[X]] If the AI tool has bias or known inaccuracies (to ensure fair and correct assessment).
[[X]] Data privacy and security for student submissions (important for protecting student information).
[[X]] How you will involve yourself in the grading loop (you should plan to review and override as needed).
[[ ]] That once the AI is set up, you won't need to monitor it (***Incorrect*** – you **should** monitor AI outputs regularly, not just "set and forget").

**Quiz 2:** True or False – *"At the Deepen level, a teacher should rely on AI tools to make important decisions about students, since the AI is data-driven and objective."*

                          --{{2}}--
AI can have hidden biases and lacks the holistic understanding a teacher has. It's a support tool, not a decision-maker, especially for significant actions like student grading or support.

?
[[ ]] True – AI's objectivity makes it more reliable than human judgment, so teachers at Deepen level can offload decisions to AI.
[[X]] False – AI can support decision-making with data, but teachers should **not** rely on it blindly for important decisions. Human judgment, context, and ethical considerations are crucial. The teacher should interpret AI outputs, not simply follow them.

**Quiz 3:** Scenario-Based Question

                          --{{3}}--
Let's test your understanding with a practical scenario. Consider how you would handle this situation using the best practices we've discussed.

You discover that an AI tutoring system in your workshop consistently gives shorter, simpler explanations to students who have struggled in the past, while giving more detailed explanations to high-performing students. What should you do?

? How should you address this AI bias issue?
[[ ]] Continue using it since it's adapting to student levels
[[ ]] Ignore it since the AI knows best
[[X]] Adjust settings to ensure all students get comprehensive explanations when needed
[[ ]] Stop using AI tools altogether

*(AI can have hidden biases and lacks the holistic understanding a teacher has. It's a support tool, not a decision-maker, especially for significant actions like student grading or support.)*
